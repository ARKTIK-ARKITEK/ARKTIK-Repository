## 🏡 **General Guidelines for Applying Organic Fertilizers**

✅ **Read the Label:** Each fertilizer has a unique nutrient profile—always follow manufacturer recommendations.  
✅ **Apply at the Right Time:** Fertilizers should be applied **during active plant growth** (spring and early summer) unless specified otherwise.  
✅ **Water After Application:** Helps nutrients seep into the soil and become bioavailable.  
✅ **Use Moderation:** Organic fertilizers release nutrients slowly—**overapplication can lead to imbalances**.
