# Composting Basics: Turning Kitchen Waste into Nutrient-Rich Soil

## 🌱 Why Compost?
Composting is **one of the easiest and most effective ways** to recycle organic waste into a **powerful soil amendment**. By breaking down kitchen scraps and yard debris, you create a **nutrient-rich compost** that enhances soil structure, boosts microbial life, and reduces landfill waste.

## 🏡 **Getting Started: The Essentials of Composting**
Composting works by **balancing carbon-rich (browns) and nitrogen-rich (greens) materials** while maintaining proper airflow and moisture.

### **1. Choose Your Composting Method**
✅ **Backyard Composting** – Traditional bin or open pile in a well-drained area.  
✅ **Tumbler Composting** – Rotating bins for faster decomposition and minimal pests.  
✅ **Indoor Composting** – Small-scale composting for apartments using sealed containers.

### **2. What to Compost**
**Greens (Nitrogen-Rich)**:
- Fruit & vegetable scraps 🍎🥦
- Coffee grounds & tea leaves ☕
- Grass clippings & fresh plant trimmings 🌿

**Browns (Carbon-Rich)**:
- Dry leaves & straw 🍂
- Cardboard & shredded newspaper 📦
- Small wood chips & sawdust 🌲

💡 **ARKTIK Insight:** Keep a **50/50 balance** between greens and browns to maintain **optimal microbial activity**.

### **3. What NOT to Compost**
❌ Meat, dairy, or oily foods (attracts pests)  
❌ Diseased plants (can spread pathogens)  
❌ Pet waste (can introduce harmful bacteria)

## 🔄 **The Composting Process: Step-by-Step**

### **1. Layer Materials**
Start with a **base of browns** (dry leaves or shredded paper), then alternate layers of greens and browns to maintain balance.

### **2. Maintain Moisture & Aeration**
✅ **Moist as a wrung-out sponge** – If too dry, add water; if too wet, add browns.  
✅ **Turn the pile regularly** – Every 1-2 weeks to speed up decomposition and reduce odor.  

### **3. Monitor & Wait**
Compost typically takes **2-6 months** to be ready. Finished compost will be **dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling**.
