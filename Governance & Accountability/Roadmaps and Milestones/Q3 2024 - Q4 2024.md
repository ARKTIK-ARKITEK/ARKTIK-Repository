---

##  **ARKTIK: WE‚ÄôVE LIVED IT, LOST IT, AND BUILT IT AGAIN**

The **ARKTIK Journey** has not been a straight path. This roadmap is not just about what we‚Äôve built‚Äîit is **a testimony of resilience, struggle, and unwavering commitment to faith, mastery, and purpose.**

2024 has been a year of **refinement, learning, setbacks, and strategic pivots.** By documenting our **struggles, obstacles, and recoveries**, we offer full transparency and a tangible record of how we built ARKTIK into a **faith-driven ecosystem** that serves the mission, not just the moment.

## **üîπ PHASE 1 | THE CHALLENGES WE FACED (Q1-Q2 2024)**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE (ACA) & FINANCIAL OBSTACLES** *(Q1 2024)*
**What Happened:**
- Both the **GLC and the X3 were purchased at the same time, from the same salesperson, and financed by the same finance manager**.
- Despite this, **American Credit Acceptance (ACA) separated the transactions and later argued that the recorded calls only pertained to the X3, which they claimed was solely the wife's responsibility, and the GLC belonged solely to the user.**
- This stance ignored **Texas common law marriage laws**, where assets acquired during marriage are considered community property.
- **Multiple complaints** were filed with the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Better Business Bureaus of Texas, Florida, and South Carolina**, yet ACA refused to resolve the matter, relying on **technicalities rather than ethical business practices**.
- **Lessons Learned:** Even when you are **disciplined, aligned, and faithful, unethical corporations will still attempt to take advantage**. Only through **clarity, balance, faith, and alignment with THE ONE can you stand strong against deception and injustice.**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ AUTONATION & VEHICLE CHALLENGES** *(Q1-Q2 2024)*
**What Happened:**
- **Deceptive financing and sales tactics** at AutoNation resulted in legal disputes over vehicle ownership and loan conditions.
- **Spring ISD transportation failures** compounded the situation, leading to increased logistical and financial strain.
- **Lessons Learned:** **Mainstream auto financing is a predatory system** that thrives on misinformation. ARKTIK pivoted towards **alternative vehicle acquisition strategies** that reduce reliance on deceptive financing practices.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ SPRING ISD & EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES** *(Q2 2024)*
**What Happened:**
- **Spring ISD‚Äôs internal mismanagement and lack of accountability** disrupted access to quality education.
- **Bureaucratic inefficiencies** proved that traditional public schooling was unreliable for families seeking **faith-based, values-aligned education.**
- **Lessons Learned:** This experience directly fueled the acceleration of **ARKTIK Education**, ensuring that parents have access to **a structured, faith-driven homeschooling alternative.**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ AWS & TECH INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES** *(Q2 2024)*
**What Happened:**
- **AWS infrastructure failures** forced a rapid transition away from unreliable cloud services.
- **Security risks and costs skyrocketed**, making it clear that external cloud dependencies were a liability.
- **Lessons Learned:** This drove ARKTIK‚Äôs decision to **fully transition to Google Cloud and Vertex AI**, ensuring that **data security and operational control** remain **entirely in ARKTIK‚Äôs hands.**

## **üîπ PHASE 2 | HOW WE ADAPTED & BUILT (Q3-Q4 2024)**

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ THE PIVOT TO GOOGLE CLOUD & VERTEX AI** *(Q3 2024)*
